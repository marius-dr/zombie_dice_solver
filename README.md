# Zombie Dice Solver
http://www.sjgames.com/dice/zombiedice/
Just some GIT + probability training while trying to make a helper/solver for the Zombie Dice and eventually turn it into a base AI for the game.
Curently runs a simulation until you "die" (get 3 shotguns) or until you "win" (get 13 brains) in one go.

TO DO:
 - Make it be aware of the risks and bank the brains
 - Add a few different behaviours (risky player, going for the win, very cautious player)
 - add support for the first expansion: http://www.sjgames.com/dice/zombiedice/doublefeature/
 - add support for the second expansion: http://www.sjgames.com/dice/zombiedice/schoolbus/
